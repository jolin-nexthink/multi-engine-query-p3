Install the multi-engine query utility on the Utility appliance

1) Connect to the Utility or Portal Appliance as "nexthink" (expects to have Ansible Playbook installed)

2) Create the folders:
    /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3
    /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/source
    /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/queries
    /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/python
    (e.g.  mkdir -p custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3
           mkdir -p custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/source
           mkdir -p custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/queries
           mkdir -p custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/python)

3) Copy the *.yml, *.sh, *.cfg, and *.txt files from the multi-engine-query
    project's Ansible\inst_multi-engine-query-p3 directory to the Appliance's 
    /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3 folder

4) Copy the following files from the multi-engine-query-p3 project's Python source directory
    to the Appliance's /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/source folder,
    Include *.py, *.sh, *.txt, and .python-version

5) Copy the files from the multi-engine-query project's Python\<env>\* directory
    to the Appliance's /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/source folder
    Where <env> = POV or PROD

6) Copy the files from the multi-engine-query project's Queries directory
    to the Appliance's /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/queries folder
    Where <env> = POV or PROD

7) If a specific version of Python is required, but must be installed from a local copy of
    the installation image, copy the required *.xz file to the Appliance's
    /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/python folder.
    Make sure that the associated controlling variables in the .yml file are set properly.

8) Once those files are present in the 
   /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3 folder, and
   /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/source, queries,
   and python folder respectively, open a shell on the Utility VM and go to the
   /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3 folder
   (It should contain the yml playbook)

8) Set the *.sh files to be executable (chmod +x *.sh)

9) Enter the following command to update all engines:
    sudo sh inst_multi-engine-query-p3.sh [-v | -vv | -vvv]
	(where -v | -vv | -vvv are the optional verbosity flags)
OR directly form the command line:
    sudo ansible-playbook [-v | -vv | -vvv] -i ./hosts-local.yml -u root \
    inst_multi-engine-query-p3.yml
	(where -v | -vv | -vvv are the optional verbosity flags)


Notes:
Note 1: you may have to run it iteratively wihth the .retry file if they do not all complete for timing reasons.
Note 2: After each run, the ansible log will be in: /home/nexthink/custom/ansible/inst_multi-engine-query-p3/inst_multi-engine-query-p3.<timestamp>.log
Note 3: If you pass -vv or higher, the .yml file may also emit some debug statements
